Are you keen on Animes?
I have developed a website that allows you to find, check and save your favorite Aniem series and films.

By fetching the [JIKAN OPEN API](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/), the Anime Search Engine searchs on its database and brigs the best anime for you, with cool titles such as "Naruto", "Tonari no Tototo", or "One Piece" among many, many others.

I have developed this website as part of my training as developer in the Adalab Bootcamp, and the web itself will be my examination for the JavaScript knowledge.
As you can see, I haven't put much effort on CSS styles (at least not yet), as I've put all my effort on JS code to be neat and strong.

## How does it work?

---

It is quite easy: simply type your search in the field provided (watch out as at least 3 characters are requited to process your search), and click the button 'Search Animes'.
A list of 50 animes will show up as result of your search, and you can simply click on as many as you wish to add the to '"My top animes" list.
"My Top animes" list will show up as soon as there is at least one anime in it.

To remove and anime from the list, you can either click on the "x" button of the anime in the top list, or just click on it again in the results list. You choose ;).
Additonlaly, your Favorites get saved on LocalStorage and they will show up everytime you open or reload the web.
